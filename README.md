# Installing

To install the dotfiles into the current directory run the following commands

```
git clone git@github.com:mrtoodamnjustin/Msys2Dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles/
./install.sh
```

If you have yet to create a gpg and ssh key for git, it is reccomended you do so beforehand, though the script will handle this dynamically.
